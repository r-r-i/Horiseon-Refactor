# Code Refactor Challenge

Refactor existing code to meet a certain set of accessibility standards with reference to the Scout Rule. I have ensured that all links are functioning correctly, CSS selectors & properties are clean and organised so they follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and comments are included before each element where changes were made.
